# Ng-Harmony-Demo

I created this for an interview ...

It's using all non-deprecated ng-harmony libs:
* ng-harmony-core
* ng-harmony-module
* ng-harmony-decorator
* ng-harmony-log
* ng-harmony-controller
* ng-harmony-util

I'll definitely let those live for years to come, hahaha .. but if you want to use them why not fork and use your own repo?

Just check out the code and see if you like it ...
